# gofingerd

A finger daemon written in Go. It's a complete implementation of RFC 1288
(FIXME: need to finish implementing query forwarding, though), with some
customization for what types of queries are permitted.

**FIXME:** More documentation & examples to follow.

### TO DO:

* Test first draft of query forwarding.
* Fix reentrancy issues with users.go.
